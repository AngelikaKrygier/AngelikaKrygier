### Hi there 👋 I'm Angelika Krygier 🙍‍♀️

I am a frontend developer who enjoys working with React and is interested in various IT systems that support companies, such as CRM, WMS, MRP and ERP. Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have learned how these systems work, and I have desired to learn how to create them. Consequently, my fascination for programming was sparked. 🧗‍♀️🥳
